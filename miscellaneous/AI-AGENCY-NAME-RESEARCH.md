## Key Research Findings

### 2025 Naming Trends for AI Agencies

1. **Human-Centered Naming** - Moving away from overly technical jargon toward names that evoke warmth and relatability
2. **One-Word Power Names** - Single-word names like "Perplexity" and "Cohere" convey confidence and scalability
3. **Strategic AI Integration** - Including "AI" directly signals expertise, though some experts suggest letting the name imply technology instead
4. **Clarity Over Cleverness** - Names should be easy to pronounce, spell, and remember
5. **Mission-Driven Identity** - Names that reflect values and outcomes, not just technology

### Domain Extension Strategy

**Best Options for Credibility:**
- **.ai** - Instant industry association, signals AI expertise ($100/year, 2-year minimum)
- **.com** - Gold standard for universal trust and recognition
- **.io** - Tech-focused, popular with startups and SaaS companies
- **.tech** - Direct technology communication

### Credibility Factors

✅ **Must Have:**
- Easy to pronounce and spell
- Memorable and distinctive
- Available domain (.ai or .com preferred)
- No negative connotations globally
- Scalable for future growth

❌ **Avoid:**
- Generic terms (smart, deep, neuro)
- Hard to spell or pronounce
- Overly similar to competitors
- Names already in use

## Professional Blurb (Source-of-Truth Version)

I am a Senior Product Designer based in Vancouver with 6+ years of experience, specializing in SaaS platforms, FinTech products, and AI-driven systems. I spent the last three years designing mobile-native banking experiences at TD Bank, working on production iOS and Android applications used by millions under strict regulatory and accessibility constraints.

In recent years (2024–2025), my work has focused heavily on AI-powered platforms, including:

- an AI content generation SaaS (TurboContent AI),
- an AI-powered FinTech compliance platform (VeritasGuard),
- and a data- and ML-enabled enterprise SaaS platform for geoscience and wellbore analysis (i2G).

I combine strong product thinking and UX fundamentals with modern AI-augmented workflows, enabling faster iteration, clearer system design, and scalable, future-ready products. My work spans early-stage concepting through to shipped, production-ready systems, with a consistent focus on clarity, usability, and real-world constraints.

### Education & Background

- Bachelor of Science in Interactive Arts and Technology – Simon Fraser University (4.5-year design school program)
- Studied design fundamentals, UI/UX design, web design, and coding (mix of computer science and design thinking)
- Career started as a front-end engineer working with React and JavaScript, which gave me deep technical understanding of web development and implementation
- Transitioned fully to product design 6+ years ago, with current focus on product thinking, design systems, UI/UX design, and user-centered design
- My technical background now enhances my design work by enabling developer-friendly, technically feasible designs and seamless handoff
- Based in Vancouver (PST), but have been working remotely on EST hours for the last 4 years (TD Bank remote role required consistent EST alignment)

### Tools & Proficiency

- Design: Figma (advanced), Framer (proficient for web design and development)
- Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (front-end engineering background)
- AI-Assisted Tools: Cursor, Figma Make (for rapid prototyping and code generation)
- Portfolio & Web Projects Built in Framer: [PixelPilot.design](https://pixelpilot.design) (designed in Figma, developed in Framer), [Revive Air](https://reviveair.in) (designed in Figma, developed in Framer)

## 1. VeritasGuard — AI Compliance Co-Pilot (Latest Work)

Product: VeritasGuard

Type: AI-powered FinTech compliance SaaS (concept + MVP)

Frontend MVP:

https://view-set-14697997.figma.site/

### What the Product Is

VeritasGuard is an AI-driven compliance co-pilot designed for banks, fintech companies, and regulatory teams. The platform focuses on making complex compliance workflows clear, explainable, and audit-ready, rather than opaque or purely automated.

It ingests transactional data, analyzes it for anomalies and risk signals, and produces plain-English, explainable insights that compliance teams can actually trust and act on.

### What I Did (Product Design Focus)

- Designed the entire product UX and UI end-to-end.
- Defined the product structure and information architecture for a compliance workflow.
- Designed a dark-mode-first dashboard optimized for long analyst sessions.
- Created flows for:
    - Data ingestion (CSV / API conceptual flows)
    - Risk summaries
    - Drill-down into flagged transactions
    - Approval, normalization, and escalation actions
- Focused heavily on progressive disclosure:
    - High-level summaries first
    - Deeper details only when needed
- Designed interaction patterns that emphasize:
    - Explainability
    - Trust
    - Audit readiness
- Applied fintech UX principles learned from TD Bank to an AI-first product.
- Used AI tooling to accelerate iteration, but retained human-led design judgment for compliance clarity.

### Why the Product & Design Stood Out (Key Design Decisions)

Explainability over black-box automation
- Designed the platform around explainability first — every AI insight could be traced back to underlying data, rules, or anomalies, critical in compliance and regulatory environments.

Trust as a primary UX metric
- Prioritized clarity, auditability, and confidence over "AI magic." The UX was intentionally calm, structured, and transparent so compliance teams could trust and defend decisions.

Compliance workflows, not dashboards
- Designed end-to-end workflows (ingestion → risk signals → drill-down → approval/escalation), instead of isolated charts or metrics. This mirrored how compliance teams actually work.

Progressive disclosure of risk
- High-level summaries first, with the ability to drill down into transactions, entities, or anomalies only when needed — reducing cognitive load in high-stakes scenarios.

Non-alarming presentation of critical data
- Avoided red-heavy, panic-inducing UI. Risk signals were contextualized and ranked, helping users assess severity without triggering unnecessary anxiety.

Audit-ready by design
- Every decision, action, and AI suggestion was designed to be reviewable later — supporting internal audits, regulator reviews, and compliance traceability.

Dark-mode-first for operational environments
- Designed for long-duration usage by analysts and risk teams, prioritizing visual comfort, contrast, and focus in data-dense screens.

Human-in-the-loop by default
- AI supported decisions, but never replaced human judgment. The UX reinforced user control, approvals, overrides, and accountability.

FinTech-informed UX patterns
- Applied real-world FinTech and banking UX principles (learned from TD Bank) to ensure the product felt familiar, credible, and production-ready.

Built for MVP realism, not concept demos
- Designed with implementation constraints in mind — clear components, repeatable patterns, and developer-ready flows rather than speculative features.

### Design Systems & Craft

- Modular, reusable components
- Clear typography hierarchy
- Consistent spacing and layout logic
- Enterprise-grade visual restraint (no gimmicks)

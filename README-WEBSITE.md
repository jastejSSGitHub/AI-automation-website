# Website Structure - IMPORTANT

## Primary Working File

**`index.html`** - This is your MAIN website file. All updates, changes, and new sections should be made to this file ONLY.

This file was created from `generated-page.html` and contains:
- ✅ Rotating draggable globe in hero section
- ✅ 3 solutions with alternating left/right layout
- ✅ Gradient text and backgrounds
- ✅ Navbar with solutions dropdown

## File Organization

- **`index.html`** → Primary working file (DO NOT modify other versions)
- **`miscellaneous/generated-page.html`** → Original source (kept as backup)
- **`miscellaneous/archived-versions/`** → Old HTML versions (archived, do not use)

## For AI Assistants

When the user requests changes to "the website" or asks to update sections, copy, or design:
- **ONLY modify `index.html`** in the root directory
- **DO NOT modify** files in `miscellaneous/archived-versions/`
- **DO NOT modify** `generated-page.html` unless explicitly asked

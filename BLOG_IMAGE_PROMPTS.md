## Quick Reference — Recommended Negative Prompts
> Add these to avoid the "AI art" look:

```
--no illustration, cartoon, painterly, watercolor, flat design, vector, clipart, anime, 3D cartoon, plastic look, toy, low quality, blurry background text, fake bokeh, lens flare overdone, over-saturated, HDR, over-sharpened
```

## Recommended Aspect Ratios
| Use | Ratio | Midjourney flag |
|-----|-------|-----------------|
| Blog hero / banner | 16:9 | `--ar 16:9` |
| In-article wide | 3:2 | `--ar 3:2` |
| In-article square | 1:1 | `--ar 1:1` |
| Phone mockup portrait | 9:16 | `--ar 9:16` |

## Recommended Midjourney Settings
```
--v 6.1 --style raw --q 2 --ar 16:9
```
> `--style raw` reduces Midjourney's "AI prettifying" and gives more photographic results.
